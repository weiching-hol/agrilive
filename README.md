### Hello, I'm Wei Ching :blush:	

A highly motivated individual, who self-learnt machine learning, and is currently a data scientist at a medtech startup. Coming from a Social Science background, I aspire to be an AI Engineer who builds impactful and scalable solutions for global problems. Two causes that I fervently believe in are poverty :rocket: and women empowerment :woman:.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on information extraction with BERT
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning model deployment - how are AI models useful when I can't deploy them?
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on real world social impact projects using machine learning or other innovative technologies
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with deepening my programming skills - picking up some computer science fundamentals now (C++)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ANYTHING! :satisfied:
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: drop me an [email](mailto:cherie.ong.wc@gmail.com)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: :running:
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a Politics, Law and Economics major student
